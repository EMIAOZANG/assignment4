1. The Python interpreter has strict rules for variable names. Which of the following are legal Python names? If the name is not legal, state the reason.

A: var, var1, _and, your_name, COLOR are legal names.
and     - LOGICAL OPERATIONS CAN’T BE USED AS VARIABLE NAMES
1var    - CAN’T BEGIN WITH A NUMBER
my-name - CAN’T HAVE ‘-‘ IN IT SINCE ‘-‘ HAS OTHER MEANINGS


2. Python automatically infers the type from the value you assign to the variable. What is the type of the value stored in each of the variables below.
a = False          Boolean 
b = 3.7            Float
c = ‘Alex’         String
d = 7              Integer
e = ‘True’         String
f = 17j            Complex
g = ’17‘           String
h = True           Boolean
i = ’3.14159’      String

3. What is the value (True or False) produced by each expression below, using the
initial values of the variables a = False, b = True, and c = False. 
b and c                   False
b or c                    True
not a and b               True
