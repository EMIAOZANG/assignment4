1. The Python interpreter has strict rules for variable names. Which of the following are

legal Python names? If the name is not legal, state the reason.

and

_and

var

var1

1var

my-name

your_name

COLOR

Answer: 
	'_and', 'var', 'var1', 'your_name', 'COLOR' are legal.
	'and' is illegal since it is a reserved word.
	'1var' is illegal because names in Python cannot start with a number.
	'my-name' is also not legal because '-' is not allowed.


2. Python automatically infers the type from the value you assign to the variable. What

is the type of the value stored in each of the variables below. 

a = False

b = 3.7

c = ‘Alex‘

d = 7

e = ‘True‘

f = 17j

g = ‘17‘

h = True

i = ’3.14159’

Answer:
	a = False ------ boolean

	b = 3.7 ------ float

	c = ‘Alex‘ ------ string

	d = 7 ------ integer

	e = ‘True‘ ------ string

	f = 17j ------ imaginary

	g = ‘17‘ ------ string

	h = True ------ boolean

	i = ’3.14159’ ------ string
	
	

3. What is the value (True or False) produced by each expression below, using the 

initial values of the variables a = False, b = True, and c = False. 

b and c

b or c

not a and b

(a and b) or not c

not b and not (a or c)

Answer:
	b and c ------ False
