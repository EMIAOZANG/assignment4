1. The Python interpreter has strict rules for variable names. Which of the following are legal Python names? If the name is not legal, state the reason.
and                 # not legal  reserved word
_and                # legal
var 		    # legal
var1                # legal
1var                # not legal  name can't start with a number
my-name             # not legal  can't use "-" in name
your_name           # legal 
COLOR               # legal

2.Python automatically infers the type from the value you assign to the variable. What is the type of the value stored in each of the variables below.
a = False           #a is Boolean
b = 3.7             #b is float
c = ‘Alex‘          #c is string 
d = 7               #d is integer
e = ‘True‘          #e is string
f = 17j             #f is imaginary
g = ‘17‘            #g is string
h = True            #h is Boolean
i = ’3.14159’       #i is string

3.What is the value (True or False) produced by each expression below, using the initial values of the variables a = False, b = True, and c = False.
b and c                   #False
b or c                    #True  
not a and b               #True
(a and b) or not c        #True
not b and not (a or c)    #False
